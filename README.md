# Hand-Gesture-to-control-computer

Hands-free operation of electronic items is new to this world. Some types of sensors are surrounded by all of us. These can vary from different shape and sizes. These can be of multiple-use or made for any specific purpose, likewise, they have their own uses of data. Such example of sensors is light sensors, heart sensor, flow and level sensor, tilt sensor, color sensor, IR sensor, accelerometer, proximity sensor, smoke, gas and alcohol sensor, and an ultrasound sensor. These sensors collect different types of data and give it to their processor for their own uses. AQ1 Sensors are used with different types of devices for their own specific tasks assigned to them. One of the best examples of sensors is its own mobile phone. It is fitted with different types of sensors to control mobile phone features like screen brightness, photo depths, and many other features. These features make the environment more interactive. The world mainly uses 13 types of sensors. These 13 types of sensors can be used in different ways or with a different configurations to get different types of work done. Each sensor can differ in their shape, size and cost.

HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS 
	Arduino UNO
	2 Ultra sonic sensor
	Jumper wire

 SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
	The project Arduino based Hand Gesture Control of Computer is implemented using Python.

	Python and pySerial (library for communicating with serial ports).

	To perform actions on our computer we use Python pyautogui library.

	The python program for this project is very simple. We just have to establish a serial communication with Arduino through the correct baud rate and then perform some basic keyboard actions. The first step with python would be to install the pyautogui module.
